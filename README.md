# Employment Process Automation using UiPath Studio


## Introduction
The human resources (HR) department plays a crucial role in any organization, as it is responsible for managing the hiring and employment process for new employees. This process can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when it involves tasks such as CV screening, sending tests to candidates, and tracking the status of applications.

To address these challenges, we have developed a UiPath project that automates certain aspects of the employment process for HR. The project streamlines the workflow by logging into a Gmail account, downloading CVs in PDF format from emails in the inbox, scanning the PDFs, checking the data in the PDFs to ensure that it is correct, storing the data in an Excel file, and sending tests to candidates via email.


## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:

* Reduce the time and effort required to screen CVs
* Ensure that the data in the CVs is accurate and complete
* Send tests to candidates


## Features
The project includes the following features:

* Logging into a Gmail account and downloading CVs in PDF format from emails in the inbox
* Scanning the PDFs (scanned image and/or native format)
* Checking the data in the PDFs to ensure that it is correct (email address, name etc.)
   * if the data is correct, stores it in a PDF file and then sends a test to that candidate via email
   * if the data is incorrect, notifies the candidate which data is not correct


## Conclusion
By automating certain aspects of the employment process, this UiPath project helps the HR department to save time, reduce errors, and make more informed hiring decisions. It is an important tool for optimizing the workflow and ensuring that the organization has the best possible candidates for the available positions.
